It helps us to send and receive data (voice or text) to our dears and nears
instantly. And we can even get any information (news, entertainment,
etc) instantly. And it is very handy to carry with us 24/7. And it makes
to do anything instantly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Something for our Profession (checking emails, learning etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Something for our dears (interacting with our dears)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get to know about happening things (Reading news)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raising urgent emergency request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice to feel that right, in a history of Hundred Thousand years of Human Mankind
in this Planet, now we invented a Device (that is MobilePhone) which will never 
going to leave Humans hand even for a single day. All other devices will 
not be used by Humans every day or they might transform to an another device.
But this Mobile Phone is not going to replaced by any other device in this
Planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the sametime of feeling Proud for the Mobile Phone invention, &lt;strong&gt;it is one of
the worst invented device which makes
Human to addict for wasting time 24/7&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if some disciplined person
stays away from that MobilePhone Addiction, Spam Promotional Calls does the
elegant job of distraction. This reduces productivity of every Humans in this
Planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;googles-new-verified-call-feature&quot;&gt;Google’s new Verified Call Feature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes even now there is no foolproof solution to identify and unpick the
Business Promotional Calls (Spam Calls). Now Google is bringing an improved
solution
&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9794513&quot;&gt;Verified Calls&lt;/a&gt;
for identifying Spam Calls and skip it in productive time. To notify Spam Calls
to receiver, Verified Calls feature on Phone App performs the task of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sending Business Caller’s Identify to receiver&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Displaying Business Caller’s reason for calling to receiver&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And Displaying Business logo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these things Google can do only if Business entity shares these informations
to Google on prior to making Calls. By viewing these 3 information, a receiver
can easily avoid picking up the Spam Calls. Especially it helps to identify
Spam Calls from a Business entity on which we are expecting a Call for some
other valid requested service. Thats one of the highlight in this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the Unethical Business entity may not share this details to Google,
so that they can breach into more customer for their product or service
Promotions. But this kind of Unethical Business entity will regularized
only if Governing body enforces every business should
share this information to Google or some other OS/APP developers while
making any Business Calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;will-google-cleans-verifed-calls-data-immediately-&quot;&gt;Will Google cleans Verifed Call’s data immediately ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again &lt;strong&gt;I hope Google will provide data cleanup option to users for these
informations&lt;/strong&gt; immediately after the Call. As similar to current Location
history cleanup option in Google accounts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ashok Karmegam</name></author><category term="MobilePhone" /><category term="Google" /><category term="Security" /><category term="Android" /><summary type="html">MobilePhone is a Fabulous Tool invented for and by Human Mankind in this Planet.

years. Even now it is one of most utilized thing for entertainment in every
households in this
planet. Now 4K LED TV with larger screen sizes are becoming more affordable.
At this time of writing lot of affordable 4K LED TV with 65 inch screen size
are available in the price range of 50,000 to 65,000 INR, which is half the
price of what was the selling price in couple of years ago. That too with
Smart features using Android TV OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;does-4k-tv-better-than-fhd-tv&quot;&gt;Does 4K TV better than FHD TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now there are very less 4K content available on the VoD services. By
considering this buyer might prefer to buy FHD TV rather than 4K TV. But that
is not correct because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4K TVs are also affordable with price slightly higher than FHD.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buying 4K TV will be future proof, as in future lot more 4K content will
be available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly FHD TV panels are not widely manufactured, so FHD TV
available in market are old technology products or even manufactured few years
back. So choosing 4K TV is the better option over FHD right now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;led-vs-qled-vs-oled-options-in-4k-tv&quot;&gt;LED vs QLED vs OLED options in 4K TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4K LED TV panels are coming with 3 variants normal backlit LED, QLED and OLED.
The difference between these 3 variants are quite discussed in multiple online
forums. This post does not cover that, instead it helps to choose the right one.
In terms of picture quality OLED is better than QLED and QLED is better than
LED. Prices of these 3 variants are also categorized based on this picture
quality. If the budget is limited, then even choosing LED 4K TV with HDR10 will
give better picture quality. Mainly for those who upgrade their old HD or FHD
LED TVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;does-4k-tv-really-need-to-be-smart&quot;&gt;Does 4K TV really need to be Smart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all 4K TVs are coming with Smart Features with Android OS. But at this time
this is not even needed, because there are lot of Android 4K TV Boxes (for 
example Mi Box) available in this market. And also now a days DTH providers in
India (Airtel, Tata Sky) have launched Android TV Set Top Box which delivers
both online content (with Android TV OS) and cable TV content from Dish. So
now a days TV manufactured should not focus more on adding Android TV OS or
chipset (Processor, Memory and Storage) to run Android TV OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel &lt;strong&gt;keeping Android TV OS build into 4K TV is unnecessary&lt;/strong&gt;. Because
keeping Android TV OS out of TV will benifit in lot of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prices of TV will come down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Power consumption of TV will reduce.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TV will become more thinner.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heat dissipation from TV will be lesser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly hardware (Processor, Memory) to run Android TV needs
periodic update to run latest OS and Apps for every 2 years (like Mobile
Phone). If Smart TV feature (Android TV OS) is in the form of external box,
then it will be
economical for user to upgrade the hardware every 1 or 2 year. But upgrading
TV every 1 or 2 year is not economical. Because TV buyers in India tend to use
a TV for minimum 5 to 10 years. Some try to use more than 10 years. &lt;strong&gt;So 4K TV
should be manufactured without any Smart Features (Android TV OS or any other
OS)&lt;/strong&gt;, that will benefit the buyer in lot of aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does any 4K TV available in market without Smart Feature ? The answer is No.
I feel TV OEM manufactures are not looking in this point of view. In today’s
market if anyone manufactures 4K TV without Smart OS then he will be the
winner in this market.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ashok Karmegam</name></author><category term="Television" /><category term="SmartTV" /><category term="Android" /><category term="Apple" /><summary type="html">Television is a major entertainment in Household for more than half century years.

etc) collected by Google for providing future recommendations about related
News, Videos, Ads, Products etc. Now Google has finally reacted for this user
concern with a solution of &lt;strong&gt;clearing the collected User Activity Data after
certain months&lt;/strong&gt; by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google’s new default policies to cleanup of User Data are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web &amp;amp; App Acitvity&lt;/strong&gt;: By default cleans 18 months old Search history on
Search engine and Apps. User can reduce this to even 3 months and also clear
it manually
anytime.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location History&lt;/strong&gt;: By default cleans 18 months old location history
collected from Google Maps. User can reduce this to 3 months. And more
importantly user can &lt;strong&gt;completely disable location history data collection&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youtube History&lt;/strong&gt;: By default cleans 36 months old Search history on
Youtube. User can reduce this to even 3 months or 18 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To configure above 3 User Privacy settings on Google account, user has to visit
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Data &amp;amp; personalization&lt;/code&gt; in Google Account settings. Note that for &lt;strong&gt;existing
Google users by default settings of above 3 options are “Don’t Auto Delete”,
so existing user should visit “Data &amp;amp; personalization” in Google Account
settings to change this&lt;/strong&gt;. But for new Google Account users from now on, it
will be by default cleanup after above mentioned months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disabling-location-history&quot;&gt;Disabling Location History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disabling Google Maps and other services to collect location history
are available in Google Accounts. We all still remember the Google’S CEO
discussion with USA congressman, in which one of the hot question thrown on
Google CEO was &lt;strong&gt;Does google track my location with this mobile phone ?&lt;/strong&gt;. And
CEO’s response was &lt;strong&gt;That is based on the services activated on Google
account&lt;/strong&gt;.
Yes most of us worry about our location privacy, as google tracks where and all
I roam. Google’s solution to that is disabling &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Location History&lt;/code&gt; option
in Google’s account. This is one of the most important setting user should
do who worries about location privacy details.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ashok Karmegam</name></author><category term="Internet" /><category term="Google" /><category term="Security" /><category term="Privacy" /><summary type="html">So far every Google user is concerned about the data (Search history, Location, etc) collected by Google for providing future recommendations about related News, Videos, Ads, Products etc. Now Google has finally reacted for this user concern with a solution of clearing the collected User Activity Data after certain months by default.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Apple jumps from Intel to ARM: One App to run on iPhone, iPad and Mac</title><link href="https://techtelegrams.com/apple/Apple-Jumps-from-Intel-to-ARM-One-App-to-run-on-iPhone-iPad-and-Mac/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Apple jumps from Intel to ARM: One App to run on iPhone, iPad and Mac" /><published>2020-06-23T17:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-06-23T17:00:00+05:30</updated><id>https://techtelegrams.com/apple/Apple-Jumps-from-Intel-to-ARM-One-App-to-run-on-iPhone-iPad-and-Mac</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://techtelegrams.com/apple/Apple-Jumps-from-Intel-to-ARM-One-App-to-run-on-iPhone-iPad-and-Mac/">&lt;p&gt;Apple’s Mac Computers (MacBook, iMac and Mac Pro) are currently running on
Intel Processors which is going to be changed to run on in-house ARM processors.
By this change Apple can deliver higher security, stability, performance and
lesser power consumption with in-house ARM processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;history-of-mac-computers&quot;&gt;History of Mac Computers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mac Computer was first launched in 1990 and it served three decades to the
human mankind for personal computing needs, and it evolved to various kind of
Mac Computers like Mac Pro, iMac and Macbook to suit the human needs. Initially
in 1990 Mac started its journey with Motorola Processors, later in 1995 it
jumps to IBM’s PowerPC and after a decade (in 2005) it jumps to intel x86.
Today in 2020 after 3 decades it jumps to ARM processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;one-app-to-run-on-iphone-ipad-and-mac&quot;&gt;One App to run on iPhone, iPad and Mac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this move, Apple claims that most of the iPhone and iPad App will run
smoothly on Mac with ARM chips. And Apple user no need to purchase two
flavours of a same app for iPhone/iPad and Mac. This reduces burden on app
developers as well who develop apps on all the 3 types of Apple products
(iPhone, iPad and Mac).
And also apps which are currently exist only on iPhone/iPad and does not exist
on Mac platform will also be used on Mac devices in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rosetta-2&quot;&gt;Rosetta 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing x86 based Mac Apps can be &lt;strong&gt;installed on ARM based Mac with the help of
Rosetta 2&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives breathing time for app developers to migrate from x86
to ARM based environment by retaining users. First version of Rosetta was used
by Apple in 2005 when it migrates its Mac product lines from PPC to Intel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mac-app-store&quot;&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this move, Apple will achive all Mac Apps distribute under &lt;strong&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/strong&gt;.
Currently that is not the case for Mac device Apps. That means currently
App developers can distribute the Apps by themself to Mac products. But
in future it will not be the case. &lt;strong&gt;All Mac App developers should distribute
the apps via Apple’s Mac App Store&lt;/strong&gt;. Similar to iPhone and iPad App Stores.
And this will allows apple to get
a slice of revenue from Commercial Mac Apps and also it will be able to
control the boundaries of App. Some of the App developers will hesitate to
accept this. But no way other than accepting it if they want to support
Apps on future Mac products.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ashok Karmegam</name></author><category term="Apple" /><category term="Arm" /><category term="Intel" /><category term="Laptop" /><category term="Desktop" /><summary type="html">Apple’s Mac Computers (MacBook, iMac and Mac Pro) are currently running on Intel Processors which is going to be changed to run on in-house ARM processors.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wearable-device-market-in-india&quot;&gt;Wearable Device Market in India&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the 95% of Smart Phone users are staying away from Smart Wearable, mainly
because the value user gets out of it is not commendable for the price. Because
most of the Smart Phone users are using mid range Smart phones (10000 to 20000
INR). And spending almost same amount as Smart Phone on Smart Wearable needs
a noticable value other than Step Counts. Because even Smart Phone App can
count the steps which user makes. Indian Smart Phone users are reluctant to put
same amount (10000 to 20000 INR) on wearables for monitoring sleep, heart rate
and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Indian competitive market
to reach more customer, a Wearable OEM should come with the price tag half of
the mid range Smart Phone price (roughly 5000 to 10000 INR) with good set
of physical activity monitoring. And also other than physical activity tracking
app, much more apps support should come to Wearable OS. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A news app which pops and displays news based on user subscribed categories.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cab booking app integration.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Online Wallets QR code for receiving money. So that user can show his Wallet
QR code to sender without taking out his phone.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently these kind of fake news spreading with digital letter format of
Indian Government and also with Government authority signature is quite
common in India. On social media if anyone receives it, immediately it gets
forwarded without verifying the authenticity of the news. It is unethical
behaviour of an Indian Citizen. Receiving legitimate news from authentic News
agency should be trusted and forwarded on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-trust-without-verifying&quot;&gt;Don’t Trust without verifying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this digital world lot of rumours can be spread by timepassers in social
media (like Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) to get more likes
and follows. As an India Citizen any such message
received on social media should not be trusted until unless it is
cross verified with authentic News forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;review&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola One Fusion Plus looks bulkier with 9.6 mm, that is mainly because
of accomodating 5000mAh battery in a 6.5 inch form factor. Build looks good
but not metal body. Overall it is a tough competitor on midrange segment
to Poco X2, Redmi Note 9 Max, Realme 6 Pro and Honor 9X Pro.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ashok Karmegam</name></author><category term="MobilePhone" /><category term="Motorola" /><category term="Android" /><category term="MidrangePhone" /><summary type="html">Motorola launched One Fusion Plus in Indian market, a new midrange smartphone with Moonlight White and Twilight Blue colour option with a price tag of 16900 INR.
